# Plan for Implementing Business Filter in Order History

## Information Gathered:
- The `OrderHistory` component fetches orders based on the `business_name` stored in local storage.
- It currently checks both `vapi_call` and `orders` tables for data.
- The component includes a search functionality that filters orders based on various fields.

## Plan:
1. **Modify `fetchOrders` Function:**
   - Ensure that the function only fetches orders for the logged-in business by using the `business_name` from local storage.
   - Remove the fallback logic that queries the `orders` table if the `vapi_call` table returns no data, as this may lead to irrelevant orders being displayed.

2. **Clean Up Code:**
   - Remove any console logs and debug information that are not necessary for production.
   - Ensure that the filtering logic in the `filteredOrders` variable is focused on the relevant business.

3. **Testing:**
   - After implementing the changes, test the component to ensure that only orders for the logged-in business are displayed.
   - Verify that the search functionality works correctly with the filtered orders.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Implement the changes in `OrderHistory.tsx`.
- Test the component to ensure it behaves as expected.
