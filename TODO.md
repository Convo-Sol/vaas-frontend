# Logo Upload Functionality for Client Management

## Steps to Complete:
1. [x] Update ClientManagement.tsx to add file input for logo upload
2. [x] Modify handleAddClient function to handle file upload
3. [x] Implement Supabase storage upload for brand logos
4. [x] Store logo URL in image_url column of app_users table
5. [ ] Test the functionality

## Current Progress:
- Plan confirmed with user
- Database schema already has image_url column
- File upload input added to the dialog (logo is optional)
- Logo upload to Supabase storage implemented
- Logo URL stored in database
- Button fixed - no longer disabled when no logo is selected
- Ready for testing

## Next Steps:
- Test the logo upload functionality (with and without logo)
- Verify that logos are properly uploaded to Supabase storage
- Confirm that logo URLs are correctly stored in the database
- Ensure logos are accessible from the stored URLs
- Test client creation without logo upload
